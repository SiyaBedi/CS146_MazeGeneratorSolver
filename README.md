# CS146_MazeGeneratorSolver

This project generates a random maze and solves it using DFS and BFS. To generate the maze, a grid with walls is 
produced. The starting point is at the top left and the finishing point is at the bottom right. Both of these walls 
have been removed. We will be creating a perfect maze, which means no inaccessible sections, no circular paths and 
no open areas. This project uses DFS as a simple maze generaton algorithm. To model the maze, use a graph data structure: 
rooms are vertices and walls are edges. The maze is solved using BFS and DFS.
